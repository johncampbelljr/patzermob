patzermob is (trying) to be a coop chess match played by two teams of chess players.  
Each player gets to vote on the next move.

This is an on-going experiment wherein I'm trying out new stuff, currently using node.js, a couple node modules, socket.io, jquery.

ToDo:
Clean up the node server code.
Clean up the client js code.  (probably should move it to a js file.)
Maybe use knockout or backbone to bind game data to the display.
Animate the move.
Fix the problem with showin gthe castle moves even when it is not a valid move.
Move the rook on a castle pending move.
Make board.js a module.
Use require/cujo to load modules.
Keep people from voting more than once.
Refactor the backend to support multiple games. (So when it hits big we can scale.)
