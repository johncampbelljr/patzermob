patzermob is (trying) to be a coop chess match played by two teams of chess players.  
Each player gets to vote on the next move.

This is an on-going experiment wherein I'm trying out new stuff, currently using node.js, a couple node modules, socket.io, jquery.

ToDo:
Clean up the node server code.
Clean up the client js code.  (probably should move it to a js file.)
Display better info about the current game--current participates, countdown to next move, etc.
Maybe use knockout or backbone to bind game data to the display.
Animate the move.
